CoinSeederv0.1

This is NOT a replacement for seeding a tournament, only a tool to help seed. 

ONLY WORKS ON WINDOWS

1) Make sure "seed.csv" is in the same folder as seeding.exe
- The first row in the csv MUST be the tag

2) Make sure "players.txt" is in the same folder as seeding.exe
- The format should be one player per line 

Ex:
Kuyashi
Joka
Mars
...
...
Etc

3) Click seeding.exe

4) "seeded.txt" will be the seeded playerlist according to the version of the CSV (which is just a downloaded version of the full Coin Rank)


Names of the files must be "seed.csv" and "players.txt".

New players or altered tags will automatically be pushed to the bottom of the list.

The generator does NOT account for "|" tags, such as "GW | Lain".

Tags that only differ by the following characters ' []().*?' or by case will be viewed as the same tag.

Some tags may be incorrectly seeded due to either duplicate names in Coin Rank or typos in entry.
